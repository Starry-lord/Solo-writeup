*Yummycrustypizza.com challenge
Organised by https://github.com/sinfulz



First I looked for a public Webpage for yummy crusty pizza, by trying to lookup :
yummycrustypizza.com

Lucky, I found a  hit so I read it and tried to navigate to /database.html, where you see a message about this page being taken off. 

Very big hint towards waybackmachine, so I managed to find the defaced page by snake squad, saved on the 22nd of February, and a few short hashes.

I stuck here for a moment trying to look into "popular" database dump websites looking for 
site:"shady websites" filetype:.bak.old
related to the pizza company.

After a couple hours I decided to retrace my steps and try a simple search of yummycrustypizza.com, which I didn't do before,
Which showed a twitter account that looked to have been taken over by someone else than the owner. 

In there I found a relevant post guiding me to a pastebin link, in which I found a recipe, and a link to some password encrypted data.

That's when the hashes came in handy, cracking them on crackstation.com revealed s1nfulz password being:
password5

using that password allowed to decrypt the data on cryptobin.co

And I got the flag!
